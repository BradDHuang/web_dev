http://www.omdbapi.com // The Open Movie Database

General search: http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=guardians+of+the+galaxy&apikey=thewdb 
Search with Movie ID: http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=thewdb 
So everything is exactly the same as explains, except must append &apikey=thewdb to the end of the url.

cd MovieAPI
npm init
npm i --save express ejs request
node app.js

review of EJS:
What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? 
EJS is a simple templating language that lets you 
generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. 
No religiousness about how to organize things. 
No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.
