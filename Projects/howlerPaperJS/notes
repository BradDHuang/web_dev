Paper.js: 
an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the HTML5 Canvas. 
It offers a clean Scene Graph / Document Object Model and a lot of powerful functionality 
to create and work with vector graphics and bezier curves(贝塞尔曲线), 
all neatly wrapped up in a well designed, consistent and clean programming interface.
