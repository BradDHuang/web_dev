// Notes of Color-Game:

make sure that the colors have spaces after the commas in the RGB expression, 
otherwise the picked color will not match the randomly selected color.
e.g.,
Correct: "rgb(255, 0, 0)"
Incorrect: "rgb(255,0,0)"

// Convert to Boolean
The value passed as the first parameter is converted to a boolean value, if necessary. 
If the value is omitted or is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (""), 
the object has an initial value of false. 
All other values, including any object or the string "false", create an object with an initial value of true.
