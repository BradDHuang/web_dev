// notes

rel: 
defines the relationship 
that the linked resource has to the document from which it's referenced.

Difference:
click(), ONLY adds listeners for existing elements;
on(), will add listeners for ALL potential future elements.
e.g. 
// $("li").click(function() {
// $("ul").on("click", "li", function() {

box-shadow: 
described by X and Y offsets (relative to the element), blur and spread radii（radius的复数）, and color.

line-height: 
defines the amount of space above and below inline elements. 

The 3-digit codes are shorthand, #123 is the same as #112233. 

Without the CSS box-sizing Property
By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:
width + padding + border = actual width of an element
height + padding + border = actual height of an element
This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appear bigger than you have set.
*********
If you set box-sizing: border-box; 
on an element padding and border are included in the width and height.

Font Awesome 5 converts the <i> element into an SVG. 
To work around this we have to wrap the <i> element in a span and select the span in our JS with an id. 
This also means we have to style the todo list trash can spans with li span in our CSS, instead of just using span.
