// notes

rel: 
defines the relationship 
that the linked resource has to the document from which it's referenced.

Difference:
click(), ONLY adds listeners for existing elements;
on(), will add listeners for ALL potential future elements.
e.g. 
// $("li").click(function() {
// $("ul").on("click", "li", function() {

box-shadow: 
described by X and Y offsets (relative to the element), blur and spread radii（radius的复数）, and color.

line-height: 
defines the amount of space above and below inline elements. 

The 3-digit codes are shorthand, #123 is the same as #112233. 

Without the CSS box-sizing Property
By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:
width + padding + border = actual width of an element
height + padding + border = actual height of an element
This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appear bigger than you have set.
*********
If you set box-sizing: border-box; 
on an element padding and border are included in the width and height.
